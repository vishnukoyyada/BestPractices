if problems has to find subset  with some condition [array,list,string]    use  slidingwindow.


-> All subsets/subsequences repetation yes or no. use subset pattern. recursion.

-> binary search for searching in array when the array is sorted.[ remember lower bound]

-> top k elements.


-> binary Dfs.

-> topological sort usefull for directed Acyclic graph

-> bfs.

-> two pointer(sorted array)


-> mostly solve linked list problems using  cycles[fast and slow pointer method].

-> to find unique element  bit manipulation.(xor)

->use hashing for counting the values in array
