To find the gcd of a number we can use this approach for better complexity.

gcd(a,b)  = gcd(a-b,b) 

important that a is greater where a>b;




in mathematical terms = gcd(a,b) = gcd(a%b,b);


and then do the process repeated 
if you find one of them is 0 then other number is gcd.


int a = 10;
int b = 5;

while (a != 0 && b != 0) {
    if (a != 0) {
        a = a % b;
    } else {
        b = b % a; 
    }
}

if (a == 0) {
    print(b);
} else {
    print(a);
}
